The swiss army knife for your food blog. A tool to add nicely and seo friendly formatted  recipes to your blog and to manage your recipe collection. 		
	

== Description ==

RecipePress reloaded is a powerful and very flexible tool to manage your blog's recipe collection. It was designed with the editor in mind and created for easy 
and fast usage.
The basically adds a post type for recipes to your site. You can publish recipes as standalone posts or include in your normal posts and pages.
Organize your recipes in any way you like. Predefined come categories, cuisines, courses, seasons and difficulties. As creating taxonomies is easy it's up to 
you which and how many taxonomies you are creating. Use listings embedded in pages to make your recipes accessible by title or taxonomy terms. Or use one of 
the widgets to create tag clouds or top ten lists.
Of course you can use all the wordpress goodies you know from posts on recipes as well: images, videos and comments.
Despite it's simplicity it's giving editors, administrators, designers and developers all the freedom to adapt the plugin to their needs. Features you don't 
need can be deactivated and are hidden from the ui then. You can even create your own layout files to complete control the looks of recipes. The default ones 
are SEO friendly, of course.
